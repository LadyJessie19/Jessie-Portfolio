            <p>Hi!ðŸ‘‹ You may call me Jessie!</p>
            <p>
              I'm a Fullstack developer originally from Rio de Janeiro, now
              based in Campo Grande, MS. I started in 2022 and mainly work with
              JavaScript, Java, and SQL. My focus is on web applications and
              user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fluent in English, I practice clean code and have experience with
              GIT. Additionally, I work as a monitor at a programming school.
              I'm excited to continue growing and contributing in the field!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm eager to keep learning and collaborating with the programming
              community. I hope to contribute my knowledge and skills as I
              continue my journey in this exciting field of technology.
            </p>
